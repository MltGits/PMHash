# PMHash
  To ensure efficient retrieval of unlabeled datasets in large-scale image search, unsupervised learning can acquire supervised information by generating pseudo-labels. However, natural images possess rich semantic content, yet even multiple objects and scenes may be present in a single-label image. Traditional pseudo-labels are represented by scalar values only, which do not provide reliable semantic supervised information for hashing learning. To overcome these limitations, a novel unsupervised deep hashing for image retrieval method using pseudo-multilabels (namely PMHash) is proposed. The proposed method designs a novel pseudo-multilabel generation network to generate a pseudomultilabel for each image. Furthermore, a tailored loss function is designed to facilitate end-toend training of the whole network, preserving the original semantic information of the images within the generated binary hash codes. Extensive image retrieval experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the improved performance
compared to other unsupervised deep hashing methods with pseudo-labels.
